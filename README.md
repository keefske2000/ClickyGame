# Super Hero Clicky Game

**Overview**
 I created a memory game with React. This application has a structure of UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

 **Tools Used**
  React.js with the following dependencies react, react-dom, react-scripts

  **Instructions**
  
  1.The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

  2.The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

  3.Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

  4.Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
